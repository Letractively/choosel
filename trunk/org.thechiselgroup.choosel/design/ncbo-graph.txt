do details query to get parents, children etc.

difficulty: 
- owl vs. obo ontologies
- getting relationships & directions
- different information for current node vs neighbours on details query

CTRL+SHIFT+D in flexviz (focussed) --> button to show XML

success/data/classBean/relations/entry/string
==> [R] at beginning means inversed relationship (optional), rest is type
==> select only entries with list/classbean > 0
==> simplified class beans
==> use child count for +

SubClass as entry/string
==> there is duplication (id same) [OBO only]
==> never display subclass arrows, so parse them first & then match them to other
    relations by id (should always appear)
    
Figure out direction:
[R] + Subclass / Superclass
ideosyncratic, e.g. production

Sequence for updating flex content

(1) start transaction / disable redraw
(2) add nodes, arcs etc (node positioning on top of existing nodes)
(3) commit transaction / enable redraw + run layout algorithm

enable/disable redraw: different canvas objects for different planes

single nodes: filtering orphans (filter package)
