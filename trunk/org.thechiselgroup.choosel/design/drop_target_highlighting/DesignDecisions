=== Implementation of Drop Target Hightlighting ===

Requirements:

- should darken not selecteable elements
- other elements should be highlighted (be above shadow plane)
- should not use cloning: flex gets reinitialized, slow with timeline
- should not remove & add node to different part of dom: flex gets reinitialized
- needs to maintain layering of windows, active widgets should not appear above
  higher level windows
- zIndex is inherited, element cannot have higher zIndex than HTML DOM parent

Possible solutions:

(A) adding shallow clone of elements above one big desktop shadow plane
    - does not maintain window ordering
    - flex gets reinitialized
    - inconsistent code
    
(B) creating floating widgets that have placeholder, one big desktop shadow plane
    - does not maintain window ordering
    - problems with layering in regular mode
    - difficulties with updates on move/resize/alpha
    - several elements need to be placed in different layer / linked
 
(C) switching on/off shadow plane for single items/windows etc.
    + maintains order
    - hard to implement
    - does not work with HTML tables that have their own z-index 
      - not using HTML tables does not work with IE8
      - needs z-index + position: relative for table elements that need to
        be placed on top
    - showstopper problem with C: decorators in HTML (introduced elements between 
      decorated element and parent) do not work well because of positioning 
      issues. Possible solution could be adding shadow elements as children 
      in the DOM tree.
      
(D) calculating partial shadow plane that has holes for drop targets
    + no adding / removing of original elements required
    + shadow code in one place, little modification of widget tree required
    + portable algorithm
