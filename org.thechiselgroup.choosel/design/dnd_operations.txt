drop set on view 
==> add new layer with SAME set (same is important as set might get modified)

drop individual on view
==> add new layer with NEW set

drop set a / individual on set b (same type, in views) 
==> add individuals from set a to set b in that view

drop set a on set b (different types, in views)
==> not possible 

drop selection on view
==> create filtered set
    problem: dropped selection can be composed of different layers 
    --> do we need different layers in resulting view
        --> yes, for now (different provides per slice of selection)
            --> induces problems when selection is extended to new layers
                --> problem of heterogeneous sets 
                    --> [[ should we change to heterogeneous sets --> cammarano ]
                    ==> LATER
                    
DONE drop selection on selection
==> merge selection models 

NEED good model for copying vs. same set operations accross multiple views

=====

Behavior of graph viewer: sets underlying different layers change contents
  during exploration (what about heterogenous sets including different
  kinds of objects??)
  
Need default operation that expands neighbourhood for NCBO
==> different operations could be shown in a fan-out view
==> different operations == different kinds of neighbourhoods

What about SE?
