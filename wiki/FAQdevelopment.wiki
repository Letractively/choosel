*I compiled Choosel, but I get the message "GWT module org.thechiselgroup.chooselexample may need to be recompiled" when I access the compiled version locally (http://127.0.0.1:8888/index.html)*

Make sure that you selected 'org.thechiselgroup.chooselexample', not 'org.thechiselgroup.choosel' in the GWT compile dialog.
