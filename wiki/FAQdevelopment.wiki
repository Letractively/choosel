== Compiling Choosel to !JavaScript ==

  * *I compiled Choosel, but I get the message "GWT module org.thechiselgroup.chooselexample may need to be recompiled" when I access the compiled version locally ( 'http://127.0.0.1:8888/index.html' )*
  Make sure that you selected 'org.thechiselgroup.chooselexample', not 'org.thechiselgroup.choosel' in the GWT compile dialog.
  * *Compiling org.thechiselgroup.chooselexample fails without any explanation*
  This might be an out of memory issue. Change the VM arguments in the GWT compile dialog under advanced to
  {{{
   -Xmx768m
   -Xss20m
  }}}
