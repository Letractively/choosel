#summary Describes how to set up an development environment for Choosel.
#labels Setup,Featured

= Setting up Java, GAE/J & GWT =

   * Install [http://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp Java] (at least Java 6 is required because we @Override annotations for interface implementations. If you manually get rid of @Override annotations, Java 5 should work, too)
   * Install [http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/download.html Google Web Toolkit]
   * Install [http://code.google.com/appengine/downloads.html Google App Engine SDK for Java]

= Setting up Eclipse =

We recommend using [http://www.eclipse.org Eclipse] for working on Choosel. The following setup is known to work:

   * [http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-ide-java-developers/galileosr2 Eclipse IDE for Java Developers 3.5 (Galileo)]
   * Subversion Plugin for Eclipse
      * [http://www.eclipse.org/subversive/downloads.php Subversive]
      * [http://www.polarion.com/products/svn/subversive/download.php Team Providers]
      * Change Setting in Eclipse Preferences: Window/Preferences-->Team/SVN-->SVN Connector-->SVN Connector = SVNKit 1.3.0
   * [http://code.google.com/eclipse/ Google Plugin for Eclipse]

= Checking out Choosel and example application from SVN repository =

   * [http://code.google.com/p/choosel/source/checkout general project checkout information]
   * Check out "org.thechiselgroup.choosel" as Eclipse project
   * Check out "org.thechiselgroup.chooselexample" as Eclipse project

= Adjust launch configuration =

   * Run configuration... --> choosel-example --> Arguments --> Adjust -javaagent part to use the app engine location on you computer

= That's it =

You should be able to run choosel-example in your development development environment now - just run the choosel-example launch configuration.

If you encounter problems setting up choosel with this guide, complain on the [http://groups.google.com/group/choosel choosel mailing list] :-)

= Optional setup =

   * To stay on top of code commits to Choosel, please consider installing the [http://www.junginger.biz/eclipse/rss-view.html Eclipse RSS Plugin] and configure it with the subversion commit feed for Choosel ([http://code.google.com/feeds/p/choosel/svnchanges/basic])
   * If you work on choosel issue tracker items, you might want to consider using the [http://code.google.com/p/googlecode-mylyn-connector/ Mylin-Google Code bridge] to get issue tracker entries into Eclipse/Mylin
   * If you use Eclipse 3.6 abbreviated package names (Preferences-->Java/Appearance), the following abbreviations might be useful for you:
