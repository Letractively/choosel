Most of the icons that are used in Choosel are based on the 22x22px icons in [http://tango.freedesktop.org/Tango_Desktop_Project Tango Icon Library].

Choosel !ActionBar icons should be

 * 22x22px
 * saved as PNG
 * available in three versions (highlighted, normal, disabled)
 * the highlighted version uses the original colors (Tango Desktop color palette)
 * the normal version is based on the highlighted version. Use the [http://www.gimp.org/ Gimp] colorize function with hue 214, saturation 30, lighting 47 to create the normal version of the icon.
 * the disabled version is based on the highlighted version. Use the [http://www.gimp.org/ Gimp] colorize function with hue 214, saturation 30, lighting 75 to create the disabled version of the icon.
